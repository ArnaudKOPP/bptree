Bplustree
=========

An on-disk B+tree for Python 3.

It feels like a dict, but stored on disk. When to use it?

- When the data to store does not fit in memory
- When the data needs to be persisted
- When keeping the keys in order is important

This project is under development: the format of the file may change between
versions. Do not use as your primary source of data.
